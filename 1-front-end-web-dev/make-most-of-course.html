    <h1>2- How to get the most out of the course</h1>
    <h2>Notes:</h2>
    <h3>Use Cornell Note taking</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Rather than coding along the same as the instructor, take key notes & review every 10 minutes or so</li>
            <li>Pull out the main keywords/questions from the notes</li>
            <li>Do a quick summary</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Try to understand why the instructor is doing this</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Why the code is important</li>
            <li>Why it's being done this way</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Then try to do the code yourself from memory</h3>
    <h3>When you hit problems</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>One of the main parts of coding is hiting problems</li>
            <li>Use Google & Stack Overflow to try to work it out yourself</li>
            <li>Very likely someone else has hit this issue themselves 1st & you can find the solution online</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Keywords/Questions:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cornell Note taking</li>
        <li>Why's the code important & being done?</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Summary:</h2>
    <p>Don't just rush through the course, copying the code on the screen as won't learn a huge amount of it. 
        Do Cornell note taking, after 10 minutes review it, understand why it's important & then do the code yourself.
        One of the main parts of coding is hitting problems. Research on Google and Stack Overflow.
