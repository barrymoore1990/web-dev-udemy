    <h1>1 - Introduction to CSS</h1>
    <h2>Notes:</h2>
    <h3>Intro</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Original websites just used HTML & was impossible to look good. The best looking ones were really complicated code</li>
        <li>Came up with CSS which is useless by itself</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Inline CSS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Can do css on html file by using style</li>
        <li>To do this, the element, e.g. background-color, it's attribute and ; must be enclosed in quotations</li>
        <li>Random note - colorhunt.co really good site for finding colours</li>
        <li>Gets error prone doing this method - e.g. if changing colour of 4 horizontal lines, got to remember to do every single 1 rather than just once</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Internal CSS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Put style elements in head of html</li>
        <li>Worth doing something dramatic to start with to make sure it's error free - not just css but other things too</li>
        <li>CSS have default values - hr has quite a few</li>
        <li>Everything that exists on webpages are essentially just boxes - use css to change any of them</li>
        <li>Chrome plugin called Pesticide shows all of the boxes on a page</li>
        <li>Internal doesn't really get used because it has to be copied into every page. That's why you use external css</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Px values - margins, borders etc</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Not 100% but from what I can make out this applies to all where you can have px size for top, right, bottom, left</li>
        <li>1 value means apply to all</li>
        <li>2 values means apply to 1. Top + bottom. 2. Right + left</li>
        <li>3 values mean apply to 1. Top. 2. Right + left. 3. Bottom</li>
        <li>4 is top, right, bottom, left, clockwise order</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>External CSS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Keywords/Questions:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>tr, thead + th, tbody + td, tfoot</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Summary:</h2>
    <p>Tables have header, body and footer (footer not used too often). Don't need to worry about columns, can use tables for layouts & have table styling in HTML but both are not recommended</p>
